    3.Building apps that run in the browser is completely different thing than the apps that run in the node.js
    4.Since JavaScript moves so fast, but browsers can be a bit slow and users a bit slow to upgrade, sometimes on the web, you are stuck to use older JavaScript / ECMAScript releases.
    5.You can use Babel to transform your code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser, but in Node, you wonâ€™t need that.
